name:cargo hold
long:You have entered the biggest room on the ship, the cargo hold. Here were once the great star fighters that protected this ship and the galaxy from the pirates, mercenaries and enemies of the United Front. Now there is only one vessel in the cargo hold. An enemy fighter that seems to have been brought in by the tractor beam. Inquisitively and carefully, you walk up to the alienâ€™s fighter to check and see if it's still operational. You hop into their cockpit and muscle memory kicks in as you try different buttons. You get a flashback to you sitting in your cockpit and staring at a picture of your family. Some memories are starting to come back to you. Although it feels like a lifetime ago. You realize that the controls of the fighter are locked down and only able to be used by the valid pilot. This is no use. You must find another way. You look around and notice some useful items in this room. There is a door to the North and East
