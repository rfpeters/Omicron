name:engine room
long:What a loud room! Multiple buzzers or alarms are blaring. The first thing that catches your eye is a huge contraption that is likely the engine. You see a meter on it. Next to the east door is a blinking light warning you that the next room has insufficient atmospheric pressure. You will probably die if you are not properly protected. There are doors to the North, East and West.
