name:lounge
long:You enter the pilot’s lounge that looks nothing like you remember it was before the journey. There used to be many pilots gambling and relaxing...you start to remember a glimpse into your past before the freezing. They walked you through this room on your way to the sickbay. You notice some green ooze on the door to the north. It isn’t clear to you which direction to go. You peek through both windows to the East and West and each is empty. A strange noise is coming from the north. There are doors to the North, South, East and West.
