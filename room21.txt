name:lavatory
long:You have entered the Lavatory. There are toilets, sinks and showers. The thought of a hot shower makes you feel human again, but there is no time for that. You quickly traverse the room to see where the other door is. As you see the next door, you notice there is an important indication. Looks like you better check out what that means. There is a room to the North.
